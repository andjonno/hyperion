# Lox
Yet another hobby lang -- An OOP language on the JVM.  All thanks to craftinginterpreters.com @munificent!

## Installation

For now you can open the project in your fav IDE (I am using Intellij IDEA which I included the .idea folder so you can use my workspace straight away.) and run Hype.main. You will be presented with an REPL prompt.

Take a look at [script.hype](https://github.com/andjonno/hyperion/blob/master/script.hype) to get a sense of the lang - though early days so don't judge it too harshly.

## Contribute

Coming soon - probably once I write more of the language itself, I may have a clearer path to open contributions appropriately.
